# Cooper

## Overview

Cooper is a **tool for Northeastern students to both submit reviews of their co-ops and filter through reviews of co-ops** left by other students.

It is intended to be similar to other job review platforms, such as [Glassdoor](https://www.glassdoor.com/) and the no-longer-maintained [Co-opâ€™d app](https://www.reddit.com/r/NEU/comments/xo3yr1/helpful_coop_reviews_app/). You can think of it as similar to Trace or RateMyProfessor but for Northeastern co-ops.

## Why does Cooper matter?

**Choosing a co-op is an important career move** - it helps you build experience, jump-starts your career, and can lead to job offers upon graduation. Despite this, **Northeastern students have little information to base their co-op decision on**. Companies often provide only surface-level information about co-ops and other review tools like Glassdoor are not specific to Northeastern co-ops.

In addition, students who have completed a co-op may want to pass on their advice, and creating a co-op review platform is a great way to aggregate that information into one place.
