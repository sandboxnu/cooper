We started building Cooper in January 2024 as a new project on the Sandbox project slate. Given that the project was very new, we had significant flexibility in choosing the technology stack. To create a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) quickly, we decided to use the [T3 Stack](https://create.t3.gg/).

At the core, the stack is built on [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) along with [tRPC](https://trpc.io/) for the type-safe API layer. The database is managed by [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) and the frontend is styled with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/). In Summer 2024, the project was migrated to use [Turborepo](https://turbo.build/) and [Drizzle](https://orm.drizzle.team/) to improve developer experience and performance. This migration was based on the template in [Create T3 Turbo](https://github.com/t3-oss/create-t3-turbo). The template was stripped down to only have `web` and `auth-proxy` apps along with standalone monorepo packages for managing the API, database, authentication, and UI components (based on [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/)).

This documentation is written almost entirely in MDX through [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/). This was to support the onboarding of multiple new developers in Fall 2024.

## Technology Stack

:::info[Testing]
Adding unit and end-to-end tests is a work in progress so we do not have any testing framework set up as of now.
