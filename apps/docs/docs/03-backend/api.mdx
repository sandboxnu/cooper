# API

The API for Cooper is built using [tRPC](https://trpc.io/).

All of the API code is in the `api` package. This package is responsible for handling all the requests that come into the API. The API is split into multiple routers, each responsible for a specific set of endpoints.

## Routers

### Types of Requests

- `list` - Fetch _all_ the objects for a particular resource in the database
- `get` - Fetch a single object by its ID, name, or other unique identifier
- `create` - Create a new object in the database
- `delete` - Delete an object from the database

### tRPC Operations

tRPC provides a set of operations that can be used to interact with the API. These operations are:

- **Query** - Fetch data from the API
- **Mutation** - Modify data in the API

tRPC also has other operations like `Subscription`, but they are not used in Cooper at the moment.

### Authentication

tRPC allows for authentication to be handled at the endpoint level. This means that each endpoint can specify whether it is a `public` endpoint (`publicProcedure`) or a `protected` endpoint (`protectedProcedure`). If an endpoint is `protected`, the user must be authenticated to access it.

In general, most of the read operations are `public`, while the write operations are `protected`.

## New Router

### Adding a New Router

To add a new router to the API, follow these steps:

1. Create a new router in the `router/` folder
2. Export it from the `index.ts` file
3. Add the route in the `root.ts` file

### Defining Endpoints

An endpoint has two parts:

- The `input` type, which defines the shape of the request. This makes uses of [Zod](https://zod.dev/) to validate the input.
- The operation (query or mutation) that the endpoint performs
