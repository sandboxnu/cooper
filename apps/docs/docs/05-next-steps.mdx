# Next Steps

Now that you have some familiarity with the Cooper codebase, try to make some changes to the codebase / add new features!

One thing to always remember is that while this documentation is a great resource for you to familiarize yourself with the project, it _will_ become outdated as the project evolves rapidly.

It is **your** responsiblity to circle back to the documentation and update it as you make changes to the codebase :unclesampointing:

Good luck and happy coding! :tada:
