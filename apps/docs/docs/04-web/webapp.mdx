# Web App

The web app for Cooper is classic [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) app.

All of the web app code is in the `web` package. This package is responsible for handling all the requests that come into the web app. The web app is split into multiple pages.

## Pages

### Dashboard

The dashboard is the main page of the web app. It allows the user to search for companies and co-op reviews.

The dashboard has two subpages:

- `jobs` - This page shows a list of reviews that the user can search through.
- `companies` - This page shows a list of companies that the user can search through.

### Review

The review page allows the user to write a review for a company. The user can rate the company on various parameters and write a review. The review is then saved to the database.

All of the heavy lifting for the review page is done by the `ReviewForm` component. On the backend, we ensure that:

1. The user is authenticated
2. The passed in `id` query parameter for the **role** is valid
3. The user has a profile associated with them

:::info[Profile]

Currently, we do **not** have a user onboarding flow in place. As a result, a user profile is never created. In order to access the review page, you will need to manually create a profile for the user. See [Drizzle Studio](/docs/backend/database#studio) for more information.
