# UI

We make extensive use of [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) on Cooper to build components.

All of the components are built using the `ui` package. We either directly use the components from the package or consume them to make new components, specific to the Cooper webapp.

## Adding a New Component

To add a new component, you can make use of the `ui-add` command. This command will create the necessary files for a new component in the `ui` package.

```bash
pnpm ui-add
```
