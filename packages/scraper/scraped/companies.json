At the time, David, Dwelo\u2019s co-founder and chief customer officer, was at Salesforce, and he and Eric had been looking for opportunities to start a business since they had met each other in college. As they began calling apartment owners and pitching a smart device platform for rentals, it became clear: this was it.

Organizations incorporating the seal into advertising and marketing materials must first pass a rigorous, comprehensive review and must annually report on their performance. NCQA\u2019s programs and services reflect a straightforward formula for improvement: Measure. Analyze. Improve. Repeat. NCQA makes this process possible in health care by developing quality standards and performance measures for a broad range of health care entities. NCQA\u2019s contribution to the health care system is measured through statistics that track the quality of care delivered by the nation\u2019s health plans. Every year for the past five years, these numbers have improved; health care protocols have been refined, doctors have learned new ways to practice, and patients have become more engaged in their care. Those improvements in quality care translate into lives saved, illnesses avoided and costs reduced. NCQA consistently raises the bar. Accredited health plans today face a rigorous set of standards and must report on their performance in more than 40 areas in order to earn NCQA\u2019s seal of approval.

We are committed to providing pure, powerful products for every family and lifestyle, all infused with the life-changing benefits of our essential oils.Our community of wellness started small in 1993, when D. Gary Young and Mary Young developed their first organic herb farming and distillation operation. At the time, Gary Young had already discovered the incredible power of essential oils, but because the quality of available oils varied so greatly, he\u2019d been unable to fully harness their potential. Mary\u2019s previous experience in the direct-selling industry enabled the Young's to fulfill their vision and establish a business that would empower its members to share truly pure essential oils with the world.After establishing Young Living in 1994, the Young's developed more farmland in Utah and Idaho and began cultivating lavender, peppermint, melissa, clary sage, and many other herbs. Fueled by a growing demand for top-quality essential oils, Young Living designed and built the largest, most technologically advanced essential oil distillery in North America. In harmony with these efforts, Young Living developed its groundbreaking Seed to Seal\u00ae process, which preserves the integrity and potency of essential oils through every step of the production process.Headquartered in Lehi, Utah, with offices in Australia, Europe, Canada, Japan, and Singapore, as well as farms around the world, Young Living stays true to the Young's original vision. With our steadfast commitment to essential oil purity, we\u2019ve inspired millions of people everywhere to experience nature's gifts of wellness, to create abundance as Young Living members, and to discover new opportunities for lifelong transformations.",

This ensures that your hospital is being reimbursed accurately for all the services provided and identifies which claims are being underpaid or denied. Measuring payer performance and understanding how payers compare to one another is a critical component to contract governance.Payer Negotiations and Strategic PricingAfter healthcare providers have established contract governance, this historical data can now be leveraged to aggressively model payer contracts in real-time while using the same platform to develop a competitive rate setting strategy and understanding the impact on their current contracts and net patient revenues.Pricing TransparencyHealthcare providers can utilize the same platform that drives contract governance, modeling and rate setting to deploy a successful patient engagement strategy for pricing transparency and consumerism. In healthcare today, this means giving patients the means to price shop for healthcare services. Value Based ReimbursementHealthcare providers will be challenged in gaining a competitive advantage as the market shifts from fee-for-service to value-based reimbursement. PMMC enables healthcare providers to lead with a high value and high volume strategy by incorporating current contract governance and risk assessment.",
